# UGV based Robotics Solution 
This repository contains the solution for an autonomous Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) that integrates sensor data, object detection, and navigation in a simulated environment using ROS 2 and Gazebo. The solution demonstrates how to work with ROS 2 nodes, sensors, and simulation tools for autonomous robot control.

Installation:

1. Ubuntu 22.04 on your Virtual Machine or WSL
https://automaticaddison.com/how-to-install-ubuntu-22-04-virtual-machine-on-a-windows-pc/

2. ROS 2 Humble on Ubuntu 22.04
https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debs.html

3. Publisher node code and Subsrciber node code is provided in the main branch this is how it would look on the temrinal.
It Generates random floating-point numbers in the range [0, 1] and publishes the values to the topic sensor_x_readings whereas the Subscriber subscribes to the sensor_x_readings topic.
